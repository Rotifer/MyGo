Go programs are composed of packages. A package consists of one or more Go source code files with code that can be combined into executable programs or libraries.
Furthermore, starting in Go 1.11, you can combine one or more packages into Go Modules. Modules are a new Go standard to group related packages into a single unit that can be versioned together. Modules enable consistent dependency management for your Go applications.
