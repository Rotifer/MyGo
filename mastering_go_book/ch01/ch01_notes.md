# Chapter 1



There are two ways to execute Go code: 

1. as a compiled language using go build
2. or as a scripting language using go run. 

The _go run_ command builds the named Go package, which in this case is the main package implemented in a single file, 
creates a temporary executable file, executes that file, and deletes it once it is doneâ€”to our eyes, this looks like using a scripting language. 


## Variables

__Very important Go rule__: 
if no initial value is given to a variable, the Go compiler will automatically initialize that variable to the zero value of its data type.

There is also the := notation, which can be used instead of a var declaration. := defines a new variable by inferring the data of the value that follows it. 
The official name for := is __short assignment statement__ and it is very frequently used in Go, especially for getting the return values from 
functions and for loops with the range keyword.

The __var__ keyword is mostly used for declaring global or local variables without an initial value. 

The short assignment statement cannot be used outside of a function environment because it is not available there. 

only _const_  and _var_ work for global variables

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	pi := 22/7.0
	fmt.Printf("PI: %0.2f\n", pi)
	fmt.Printf("Absolute PI: %0.2f\n", math.Abs(pi * -1))
}
```

### Code Notes

- Show how to print formatted values
- Use of _math_ package
- Note: the expression 22/7 returns an _integer_ type; to return a _float_, you need to set one of the operands as a _float_ type



Go does not allow implicit data conversions like C.

For conversions that are not straightforward (for example, string to int), there exist specialized functions that allow you to catch issues 
with the conversion in the form of an error variable that is returned by the function.

## Controlling program flow

A very common pattern in Go that is used almost everywhere. This pattern says that if the value of an error variable as returned from a function is nil, 
then everything is OK with the function execution. Otherwise, there is an error condition somewhere that needs special care.

The ___switch___ statement has two different forms. In the first form, the switch statement has an expression that is being evaluated, whereas in the second form, 
the _switch_ statement has no expression to evaluate. In that case, expressions are evaluated in each case statement, which increases the flexibility of switch. 

## Iterating with for loops and range

Go supports ___for___ loops as well as the ___range___ keyword for iterating over all the elements of arrays, slices, and  maps.

### The traditional C-style _for_loop

- Initiation, Condition, Increment

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// countdown
	fmt.Println("Commencing countdown.......")
	for i := 10; i > 0; i-- {
		fmt.Printf("%d\n", i)
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	}
	fmt.Println("Blast-off!")
}
```

### The _foreach_ style of _for_ loop for iterating over a _slice_

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	animals := []string{"cat", "dog", "rat", "cow"} // Declare a slice
	for i, animal := range animals {
		fmt.Printf("Index: %d => Animal %s\n", i, animal)
	}
}
```

## Getting user input

The ___fmt.Scanln()___ function can help you read user input while the program is already running and store it to a string variable, which is passed as a pointer 
to _fmt.Scanln()_. The fmt package contains additional functions for reading user input from the console (_os.Stdin_), from files or from argument lists.

## Working with command-line arguments

Usually, user input is given in the form of command-line arguments to the executable file. 

By default, command-line arguments in Go are stored in the ___os.Args___ slice. 
Go also offers the ___flag___ package for parsing command-line arguments, but there are better and more powerful alternatives.
